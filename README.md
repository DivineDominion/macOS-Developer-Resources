## About

This document is maintained by me, [Isaac Halvorson](https://hisaac.net). I started this after making the jump from iOS development to macOS development, and noticing a distinct lack of good content pertaining specifically to developing for the Mac platform. After some chatter recently about this on Twitter, I figured it was high time someone started to catalog these things somewhere.
